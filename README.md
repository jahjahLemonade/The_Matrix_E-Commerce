  I am looking for contributions to an idea I have for an e-commerce website that is similar to how Neo in the first matrix was able to learn king fu by having a  program installed in his brain.

  He was able to learn kung fu in a matter of seconds and that's what I want this e-commerce site to center around. My vision for this website is to give off the appearance that you can easily shop all these amazing programs and purchase them. For example, the site might have a dodge bullets program you can buy. I imagine how a customer would intake the program is by taking a single pill, like how Morpheus presented Neo with the red and blue pill, but instead of Morpheus giving the pill, it will be delivered to the customer's home in a package like any other online purchase. It comes in a single pill and all the customers do is take the pill and BAM!! they're able to dodge bullets like in The Matrix. This is meant to be a silly site, but with a cool UI. I am very new to open source, so any positive feedback would be appreciated. Thanks for reading and I hope to get a pull request from you soon.
